***Git (/ɡɪt/)[8] is a distributed version control system[9] that tracks versions of files. It is often used to control source code by programmers who are developing software collaboratively.***

Design goals of Git include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows — thousands of parallel branches running on different computers.[10][11][12]

*As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, Git maintains a local copy of the entire repository, also known as "repo", with history and version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. A repository is stored on each computer in a standard directory with additional, hidden files to provide version control capabilities.[13] Git provides features to synchronize changes between repositories that share history; copied (cloned) from each other. For collaboration, Git supports synchronizing with repositories on remote machines. Although all repositories (with the same history) are peers, developers often use a central server to host a repository to hold an integrated copy*

**GitHub ** is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. It uses Git to provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.[8] Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.[9]

It is commonly used to host open source software development projects.[10] As of January 2023, GitHub reported having over 100 million developers[11] and more than 420 million repositories,[12] including at least 28 million public repositories.[13] It is the world's largest source code host as of June 2023. Over five billion developer contributions were made to more than 500 million open source projects in 2024

Finance
GitHub was a bootstrapped start-up business, which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.[24]

In July 2012, four years after the company was founded, Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million in venture capital[8] with a $750 million valuation.[25]

In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million (~$314 million in 2023) of venture capital in a series B round. The lead investor was Sequoia Capital, and other investors were Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, IVP (Institutional Venture Partners) and other venture capital funds.[26][27] The company was then valued at approximately $2 billion.[28]

As of 2023, GitHub was estimated to generate $1 billion in revenue annually.
The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., was formed in 2007 and is located in San Francisco.[29]

On February 24, 2009, GitHub announced that within the first year of being online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of which were formed in the previous month. At that time, about 6,200 repositories had been forked at least once, and 4,600 had been merged.

That same year, the site was used by over 100,000 users, according to GitHub,[30] and had grown to host 90,000 unique public repositories, 12,000 having been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000 repositories.

GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.

Storing your code in a "repository" on GitHub allows you to:

Showcase or share your work.
Track and manage changes to your code over time.
Let others review your code, and make suggestions to improve it.
Collaborate on a shared project, without worrying that your changes will impact the work of your collaborators before you're ready to integrate them.
Collaborative working, one of GitHub’s fundamental features, is made possible by the open-source software, Git, upon which GitHub is built.
